# What Are Configurable Actions?

For non-technical users at ESS, **configurable actions** are custom buttons or menu options that appear in multiple locations in the web interface. Currently they are used only on the dataset data file tab, but they will soon be available on the dataset details tab, datasets list, and the selection.

These actions make it easy to perform specific tasks with just a click. Examples include:

- **Download All Files:** Download every file in a dataset in one go.
- **Download Selected Files:** Download only the files you have selected from a dataset.
- **Download Jupyter Notebook:** Get a ready-made Jupyter notebook that’s already filled in with information about your selected dataset.
- **Publish or Unpublish a Dataset:** Change whether a dataset is visible to others or kept private.
- **Quick Links:** Jump directly to important resources, like the ESS homepage.

Each action is set up behind the scenes by the IT team through the FE configuration during deployment. The system automatically fills in any technical details for you (like dataset IDs or file locations), so you don’t have to worry about them.

**In summary:**  
Configurable actions help you get your work done faster and more easily, without needing to worry about technical steps or complicated processes.
