# Using Configurable Actions at ESS

Configurable actions are special buttons in the ESS user interface that help you perform useful tasks with your datasets, such as downloading files, launching Jupyter notebooks, or publishing data.

## What Are Configurable Actions?

- **Action Buttons:** These appear in the data portal and other tools.
- **Purpose:** Each button lets you quickly do something—like download all your data, download selected files, or make your dataset public.
- **Smart Controls:** Actions may only appear or become clickable when you have permission or when it makes sense (e.g. if you have selected files).

## What Can Actions Do?

- **Download data** (all files or only selected files)
- **Generate notebooks** (for Jupyter or SciWyrm)
- **Create download links**
- **Change dataset status** (publish/unpublish)
- And more, as new options are added

## Common Button Types

| Icon / Label            | What it does                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ![download](icon)       | Download all or selected files as a zip     |
| ![jupyter](icon)        | Download or open a Jupyter notebook         |
| "Publish"               | Make your dataset publicly available        |
| "Unpublish"             | Make your dataset private again             |
| "ESS"                   | Link to an ESS webpage                      |

*(Note: The actual icon may look different in your UI.)*

## Why Do Some Actions Appear Grayed Out or Hidden?

An action button might be disabled (grayed out) or hidden if:
- You do not have necessary permissions (e.g. not the owner).
- The action isn't possible (e.g. no files selected).
- The dataset is already published or unpublished.

Hover over a disabled button for hints about why it's not available.

## Security and Permissions

Some actions are only available to dataset owners or users in certain groups. If you think you should see an action but don't, contact the data team.
